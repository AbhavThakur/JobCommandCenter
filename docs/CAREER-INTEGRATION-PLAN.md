| R1  | Live PM job sourcing             | Agent | Seed data now includes PM jobs; Render worker still needs persistent scan inputs |

| R3  | Lock down seed write permissions | Agent | After data is stable, change `jobs`/`companies` writes back to worker-only       |

## Environment Variables

### Vercel Env Vars

Set these in **Vercel Dashboard → Project → Settings → Environment Variables**:

```env
# Firebase Client SDK (already set if app was deployed before)
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id

# Career integration (NEW)
VITE_CAREER_API_BASE_URL=https://your-career-worker.onrender.com
VITE_ALLOWED_AUTH_EMAILS=your@email.com,aanya@email.com
```

### Worker Env Vars

Set these in **Render Dashboard → Service → Environment**:

```env
# Firebase Admin SDK
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=firebase-adminsdk-xxxxx@your_project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com

# CORS
ALLOWED_ORIGIN=https://personalgrowthos.vercel.app

# Optional: scan behavior
CAREER_WORKER_RUN_SCAN=true

# For first-time testing only — remove after confirming auth works
# CAREER_WORKER_ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED=true
```

## Worker Deploy (Render/Railway)

### Option A: Render

1. Create a **New Web Service** on Render
2. Connect to your career-ops repo (or push worker/ separately)
3. Settings:
   - **Root Directory:** (leave empty if full repo, or set to `worker/` if separate)
   - **Build Command:** `npm install`
   - **Start Command:** `npm run worker`
   - **Instance Type:** Free
4. Add env vars from [Worker Env Vars](#worker-env-vars)
5. Deploy

### Option B: Railway

1. Create a new project → Deploy from GitHub
2. Same settings as Render
3. Railway auto-detects Node.js; set start command to `npm run worker`

### Important Notes

- Render free tier sleeps after 15 min of inactivity — first request after sleep takes ~30s
- This is fine for MVP since search is async (user sees "queued" → "running" → "completed")
- For always-on, upgrade to paid tier or use Railway's free tier (which has usage limits but no sleep)

## Seed Scripts Usage

Once I create the seed scripts (C1, C2), you'll run them like:

```bash
# From career-ops root, with .env containing Firebase Admin credentials
cd /Users/A3100515/Proj/career-ops

# Seed companies from bellandur-companies.md into Firestore
node worker/seed-companies.mjs

# Seed existing scan-history/pipeline jobs into Firestore
node worker/seed-jobs.mjs
```

These are one-time scripts. After seeding, the worker handles ongoing sync.

## Verification Checklist

After all manual steps are done, verify:

- [ ] Visit https://personalgrowthos.vercel.app
- [ ] Click "Continue with Google" → signs in with your allowlisted email
- [ ] Navigate to Career → Jobs tab
- [ ] See "No jobs found" (before seeding) or actual jobs (after seeding)
- [ ] Click "Start async search" → status shows "queued"
- [ ] Worker picks up the search → status changes to "running" → "completed"
- [ ] Job cards appear with company, title, location, score, apply link
- [ ] Report/PDF links work (after C5 is done)
- [ ] Career → Companies tab shows Bellandur companies from Firestore (after C3)
- [ ] Sign in with non-allowlisted email → rejected

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk                                    | Severity | Mitigation                                                                       |
| --------------------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Render free tier cold starts            | Medium   | UI already handles async status; consider paid tier later                        |
| Playwright not available on Render free | High     | Worker only syncs parsed data for now; full scan needs paid tier with Playwright |
| Firebase rules too restrictive          | Low      | Test with emulator first; rules allow signed-in reads                            |
| No jobs match role keywords             | Medium   | Role keyword lists are broad; will improve with usage                            |
| Service account key exposure            | High     | Never commit .env; use Render's env var UI                                       |
| Firestore read costs                    | Low      | 200 jobs × 2 users = negligible on free tier                                     |

## Decision Log

| Date        | Decision                      | Rationale                                           |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 29 May 2026 | Firebase-first (no Supabase)  | Already integrated; avoids two auth systems         |
| 29 May 2026 | Render/Railway for worker     | Free tier; separates long-running scans from Vercel |
| 29 May 2026 | Async search                  | Prevents timeout; better UX for slow scans          |
| 29 May 2026 | Role-based profiles           | Avoids personal names; extensible for future roles  |
| 29 May 2026 | GrowthOS read-only MVP        | Safer; avoids corrupting career-ops data            |
| 29 May 2026 | Google Auth + email allowlist | Private access; easy for both users                 |
